# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/beer.png
    - assets/images/SVG/Horns.svg
    - assets/images/SVG/Halo.svg
    - assets/images/SVG/coin.svg
    - assets/images/SVG/crown.svg
    - assets/images/SVG/twoCards.svg
    - assets/images/SVG/bottle.svg
    - assets/images/SVG/playing_bottle.svg
    - assets/lottiefiles/beerLotie.json
    - assets/lottiefiles/flip_coin.json
    


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Gagalin
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gagalin/Gagalin-Regular.otf
    - family: Bukhari
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Bukhari/Bukhari Script.ttf
    - family: Oswald
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/static/Oswald-SemiBold.ttf    
    - family: Bungee
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Bungee/Bungee-Regular.ttf   
    - family: Monoton
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Monoton/Monoton-Regular.ttf
