# BottomsUp

Drinking Games to play at Parties !!!

- Currently in development. 


-The idea of the app is to include multiple mini games:
-truth or dare / bottle spin / heads or tails and many more ... 

-The app uses animations of Lottie Files type managed by Animation Controllers.
-Some graphics are imported and some are custom designed using Adobe Illustrator.

-The data (.json format) is fetched onto database using a node.js script -> that will fastly populate entries in the firestore.

-The data is then used in real time from firestore -> in order to generate UI.


# Goal for this year:

Have 5 drinking games developed - 2.5 / 5 currently finished.
Add google ads in order to create revenue.
